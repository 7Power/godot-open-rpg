# Godot turn-based RPG

Learn to create turn-based combat with this Open Source RPG demo âš”

Made with Godot 3.1 alpha. The project is just getting started. You can play with our [Open Source A-RPG demo](https://github.com/GDquest/make-pro-2d-games-with-godot/) in the meantime.

## The vision

I built the combat system to create an upcoming free tutorial series about turn-based combat on GDQuest. But it does not end here. This project is fully open source so that we can work on it together! The idea is to turn it into a nice little JRPG demo that shows some of the best practices in the Godot game engine.

## Contributing Guidelines

All contributors are welcome ðŸ™‚. However, to make the experience as smooth as possible for everyone working together, I need you to follow a few guidelines. Here's a summary of most important two:

- Let's get in touch and communicate! Use the issues tab to let everyone know what you are working on, to report bugs, and to suggest improvements. Join the [GDquest Discord server](https://discord.gg/87NNb3Z) to talk about the project live
- If you're contributing code, we follow the [GDScript styleguide](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html). Try to make your code clean and self-documenting as it helps us to build upon each other's work, and users to learn from the demo. Also, we're here to review and to help you improve your code.
