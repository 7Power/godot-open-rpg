# Game concept

A turn-based role-playing game engine inspired by the old installments in the
Final Fantasy series.

## The goal

The goal of this project is to provide the gamedev community with a demo that
shows how game systems interlock together in a sizeable game, in Godot.

It is a 2D JRPG inspired by the old installments in Final Fantasy series.

This demo is both an educational and a community-driven, international project. If it
stems from a classic turn-based game like Final Fantasy IV or V, the design process involves contributors from all around the world to steer the project's design moving forward.

The initial demo intentionally draws inspiration from RPG Maker. The idea is to
make the engine's foundations both classic, so we all have a reference to work
from, and flexible so we can all contribute to the project creatively.

## Story

Robi and Godette are on the way to play with their friend Godot. However, they can't decide on the game to play.

On the way, they meet with a cat who hears them talking:
"You should play the ball!", Says the cat, "I know where you can get the roundest, the smoothest, the most exciting ball."
Excited by the cat's idea, the go out of their way and embark on a journey to find the ball.

When they finally find the ball, they are thrilled. That is, until they put their hands on it, only to see it's old and dusty. It's missing air, so it's no good to play.

The cat is also there. It argues that balls suck anyway and that it knows a better game. They could play swords and shields! All they need is cardboard and sticks. He happens to know where they can find the shiniest, the smoothest stick. Once again, our heroes deviate from their path to find it.

The story plays again and again. The stick is bent, and the cardboard is wet. But the cat always has a solution: it knows a better toy and a better game.

Eventually, the sun starts to set, and Robi and Godette realize they are late. They drop all their toys and run to the playground. Godot is there, running after a butterfly.

## Mechanics ##

The game's mechanics draw from classical JRPGs.

The idea is to produce a standard yet a flexible foundation, primarily inspired by old Final Fantasy games and RPG maker, to allow for greater creative freedom with the game's content.

### Combat system

Battle encounters are turn-based. The battlers act one after the other in an order decided depending on their speed.

Each character has a distinct set of available combat actions depending on their job.
